This project represents my solution for the Clipboard Landing Page challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). The challenge aimed to create a visually appealing landing page for a clipboard management application, showcasing its features and encouraging users to sign up.

## Overview

The Clipboard Landing Page challenge focused on building an attractive and informative landing page that effectively promotes a clipboard management application. The goal was to create a design that captures attention, communicates the key features of the application, and encourages users to take action.

Throughout the project, I strived to understand the design requirements and implemented a responsive layout using HTML and CSS. The objective was to create a visually engaging landing page that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
